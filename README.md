# Hackaton-Quantum-Black

A project executed with four other students during a two-days hackaton organized by McKinsey's AI branch: Quantum Black.

Two tasks are treated in this project:

- Image classification: classify image depending on wether it contains a silo

- Image segmentation: once a silo is detected, segment it within the image. Outputs are masks with highlight the position of the silo.
